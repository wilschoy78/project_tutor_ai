TITLE OF THE PROJECT 
Teacher-Tutor Generative AI using LangChain: An Open-source Approach to Personalized  Learning
NAME OF PROPONENT 
WILSON A. GAYO
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT 
Teacher-Tutor Generative AI, powered by the open-source platform LangChain, tackles educational  inequality by providing every student with personalized learning paths, real-time AI feedback, and  teacher collaboration. This empowers educators, boosts student engagement, and closes  achievement gaps, paving the way for a future where personalized learning is not a privilege but a  right for every child.
FEATURES OF THE PROJECT 
•	Personalized learning paths: AI creates tailored learning journeys for each student, adapting  to their unique needs and preferences. 
•	Real-time feedback: Students receive instant feedback that supports their understanding and  engagement throughout the learning process. 
•	Teacher collaboration: AI acts as a supportive colleague to teachers, expanding their  capacity for personalized guidance and deeper student interactions. 
•	LangChain powered: Open-source framework promotes accessibility, customization, and  ongoing community development. 
•	• Seamless integration: Effortlessly integrates into existing learning management systems  (LMS) like Moodle, ensuring a cohesive and adaptable learning environment.
COMMENTS / SUGGESTIONS FROM THE PANEL MEMBERS
• Learning Management System Implementation using Moodle: Ensure secure data extraction via Web Services API and handle course format variations.
• Moodle plugin development for AI integration: Create a native-feeling integration with single sign-on (SSO) and real-time synchronization.
• Generative AI development: Implement a RAG system using LangChain and ChromaDB, grounded exclusively in Moodle course content to prevent hallucinations.
• Infrastructure: Ensure compatibility with Apple Silicon and design for single-server deployment (e.g., Render/Fly.io).

RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE PANEL MEMBERS DURING THE FINAL PRESENTATION
• Personalized learning paths: Analyze quiz scores and engagement to dynamically adjust content sequences and show visual progress.
• Real-time feedback: Provide immediate, context-aware feedback on student responses, citing specific Moodle materials.
• Teacher collaboration: Build a dashboard for teachers to monitor AI interactions, approve content, and fine-tune AI behavior.
• Data Privacy & Security: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) and ensure FERPA compliance for student data.
